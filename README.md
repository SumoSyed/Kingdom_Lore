# Kingdom Lore

Kingdom Lore begins with the story of how you obtain your kingdom. Players will input their name and will be thrust into the world of Loreless. Lay-back as you send your fellow knights on quests, to recruit soldiers for your army and to fight for you. Go about your kingdom and approve constructions to make the local population happy. Go on an adventure on your own and seek out the lore of your kingdom.
